# Assumptions of Logistic Regression, Clearly Explained
#### Understanding and implementing the assumption checks behind one of the most important statistical techniques in dataÂ science - Logistic Regression

- Logistic regression is a highly effective modeling technique that has remained a mainstay in statistics since its development in the 1940s.  
- Given its popularity and utility, data practitioners should understand the fundamentals of logistic regression before using it to tackle data and business problems.  
- In this project, we explore the key assumptions of logistic regression with theoretical explanations and practical Python implementation of the assumption checks.

### Special Thanks
- @dataninj4 for correcting imports and adding .loc referencing in diagnosis_df cell so that it runs without errors in Python 3.6/3.8
- @ArneTR for rightly pointing out that VIF calculation should include a constant, and correlation matrix should exclude target variable
